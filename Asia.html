			<td><p><b>Maldives: </b><br>This far-flung destination, which is located miles from civilization in the Indian Ocean, is made up of about 1,200 islands that provide an idyllic atmosphere that's pretty much paradise.

The best way to experience this slice of paradise? In one of its many overwater bungalows, of course.
				There are beautiful places to visit here as:
				<ul>
					<li>Valigandu Island Beach</li>
					<li>Banana Reef</li>
					<li>Milaidhoo Island</li>

			<td><p><b>TOKYO, JAPAN: </b><br>"Animated" is perhaps the best word to describe Tokyo. Crazy about its anime, Japan's mega city is constantly buzzing with movement – feet clacking down sidewalks, cars zooming along streets, subway trains humming below ground, ships cruising in and out. Besides the super-advanced lifestyle, the museums and historical sites are world-class. There are beautiful places to visit here as:
				<ul>
					<li>Tokyo National Museum</li>
					<li>Meiji Shrini</li>
					<li>Sensoji Temple</li>
					<li>Imperial Palace</li>
					<li>Ginza</li>
				</ul>
				The best time to visit Tokyo is between March and April and September and November. Autumn ushers in colorful foliage and comfortable temperatures.

			<td><p><b>PHUKET, THAILAND: </b><br>Pure white sands, aquamarine waters and limestone cliffs await travelers who visit Thailand's southwestern island of Phuket. Surrounded by the Andaman Sea and about an hour by plane from Bangkok, this island is a little piece of paradise. There are beautiful places to visit here as:
				<ul>
					<li>Promthep Cape</li>
					<li>Big Buddha</li>
					<li>Nai Harn Beach</li>
					<li>Kata Noi Beach</li>
					<li>Phuket Spas</li>
				</ul>
				The best time to visit Phuket is between November and April when weather conditions are ideal for beach activities, such as swimming and boating. The six months between May and October are monsoon season, and although accommodation prices are much lower this time of year, the water conditions can be dangerous.

			<td><p><b>JAIPUR, INDIA: </b><br>Travel to Rajasthan's capital to marvel at incredible architecture. Jaipur, India's biggest claim to fame is spellbinding Hawa Mahal, a pink palace that was modeled after Krishna's crown (a Hindu god) and features an astounding 953 windows. The windows allowed the original occupants, the ladies of the royal family, to view the comings and goings of the Indian city without being seen. There are also the Jaigarh Fort, Panna Meena ka Kund and Jantar Mantar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that displays larger-than-life astronomical instruments. There are beautiful places to visit here as:
				<ul>
					<li>Hawa Mahal</li>
					<li>Amer Fort</li>
					<li>City Palace, Jaipur</li>
					<li>Jal Mahal</li>
					<li>Sheesh Mahal</li>
				</ul>
				Best Time To Visit Jaipur. The best time to visit Jaipur is during the winter season in the months of October and March when temperature ranges from 8°C to 22°C.

			<td><p><b>Agra, INDIA: </b><br>If you consider yourself a world traveler, you're bound to make the pilgrimage to Agra. Each year, millions come from around the globe to this (relatively) small city in northern India. "Why?" you ask. Two words: Taj Mahal. This famous monument has immortalized the love of an emperor and his wife since its completion in 1648. Epitomizing the ornate Mughal architectural style, the Taj Mahal has made jaws drop and hearts swoon for centuries. There are beautiful places to visit here as:
				<ul>
					<li>Taj Mahal</li>
					<li>Agra Fort</li>
					<li>Itmad-ud- Daulah's Tomb</li>
					<li>Fatehpur Sikri</li>
					<li>Mehtab Bagh</li>
				</ul>
				The best time to visit Agra is from November through February. That's because this long "winter" sees daily temperatures ranging from the 70s to low 80s.
